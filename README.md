## Settings 

I have implemented a few settings to make the plugin a bit more customizable:

1. **Auto completion. This stores the last few usages so you can reselect an old statement**

You may set this to whatever you'd like! It just has to be a number though.

2. **Token Replacer. If you are storing your token to prevent logouts, there is a way to replace your token, just in case!**

You may set this to whatever you'd like!

3. **Output Formatting. You can format how you would like your eval output.**

You may format your output to whatever you'd like! Here is a key:

- `{time}` Time taken to execute. Example: `Time took: {time}`
- `{type}` The return type. Example: `Typeof {type}`
- `{output}` The evaluted output. Example: `{n}{output}`
- `{n}` A new line (or `\n`). Example: `{n}`
- `{depth}` The depth to go. Example: `Depth ${depth}`
